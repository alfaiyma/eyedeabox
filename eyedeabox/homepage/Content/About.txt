    Hello everyone and thank you for visiting this little app.
If you're anything like me, you're always on the looking for ideas that could turn into projects,
and with enough work, maybe even a business. But unfortunately, we're often confined to problems and issues that we confront
in our own lives, oblivious to new ideas, problems and needs not being made in the lives of others.
This app is here to guide and inspire by giving a glimpse to needs/ideas/problems that others are tweeting about.
I wish y'all the best on your 'eye'-dea-mining.
